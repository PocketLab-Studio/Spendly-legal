PocketLab Studio ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Spendly ("the App") handles your information.

## Information We Collect

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.** All your financial data stays on your device.

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores the following information locally on your device:
- Transaction records (amounts, dates, categories, descriptions)
- Budget information
- Savings goals
- Recurring expense data
- App preferences and settings

### Camera Permission

**Why we need it:** To scan receipts and automatically extract transaction information.

**How we use it:**
- When you choose to use the receipt scanning feature, the App accesses your camera to capture receipt images
- Images are processed to extract merchant name, amount, date, and items
- **Receipt images are NOT stored permanently on your device**
- **Receipt images are NEVER uploaded to our servers**
- Receipt scanning is optional - you can manually enter transactions instead

**Third-party processing:** Receipt images may be sent to OpenAI for text extraction. See "Third-Party Services" below.

### Photo Library Permission

**Why we need it:** To allow you to select existing receipt images from your photo library for scanning.

**How we use it:**

- Selected images are processed the same way as camera-captured receipts
- Images are NOT stored or uploaded

### Biometric Authentication (Face ID/Fingerprint)

**Why we need it:** To secure your financial data with biometric authentication.

**How we use it:**

- Used to verify your identity before accessing the App
- Biometric data never leaves your device and is handled by your device's operating system

## Third-Party Services
