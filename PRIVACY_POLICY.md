# Privacy Policy for Spendly

**Last Updated: November 23, 2025**

## Introduction

Thank you for using Spendly ("we," "our," or "the app"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile budgeting application.

**TL;DR: Your financial data stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or sell your personal information.**

## Information We Don't Collect

Spendly is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:

- ❌ Your financial transactions
- ❌ Your budget information
- ❌ Your savings goals
- ❌ Your personal identification information
- ❌ Your location data
- ❌ Your contact information (unless you contact us for support)
- ❌ Any personally identifiable information (PII)

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local Storage Only
All your financial data is stored **locally on your device** using:
- AsyncStorage (React Native's local storage system)
- No cloud servers
- No external databases
- No third-party data collection

Your data includes:
- Transactions
- Budgets
- Categories
- Savings goals
- Recurring transactions
- Achievements
- App preferences (theme, currency, biometric settings)

### You Control Your Data
- **Export**: You can export your data as a CSV file at any time
- **Backup**: Cloud backup feature uses YOUR cloud storage (iCloud/Google Drive) - we never see this data
- **Delete**: Uninstalling the app removes all data permanently

## Features That Use Device Permissions

### Optional Permissions We Request:

**1. Biometric Authentication (Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint)**
- **Purpose**: Lock your app for security
- **What we access**: We only receive yes/no if authentication succeeded
- **What we don't access**: Your biometric data itself (handled by iOS/Android)

**2. Notifications**
- **Purpose**: Bill reminders and recurring transaction alerts
- **What we access**: Permission to send local notifications
- **What we don't access**: Your notification history or other apps' notifications

**3. File System Access (for Export/Backup)**
- **Purpose**: Save CSV exports and backup files
- **What we access**: Permission to write files to your device
- **What we don't access**: Other files on your device

### No Network Requests
Spendly operates **100% offline**. We do not:
- Send data to remote servers
- Track your usage
- Use analytics services
- Display ads that track you

## In-App Purchases

### Payment Processing
When you purchase Spendly Premium:
- Payments are processed by **Apple App Store** or **Google Play Store**
- We receive only a subscription status (active/inactive)
- We do NOT see your payment information (credit card, billing address, etc.)
- Refunds are handled by Apple/Google, not by us

### What We Store About Subscriptions
We store locally on your device:
- Subscription type (monthly/yearly/lifetime)
- Subscription status (active/inactive)
- Activation date

This information is stored **only on your device** and is not transmitted anywhere.

## Third-Party Services

### Expo Framework
Spendly is built using Expo, a React Native framework. Expo may collect minimal technical data for app functionality:
- Crash reports (anonymous)
- App version information
- Device type (iOS/Android version)

For more information, see [Expo Privacy Policy](https://expo.dev/privacy).

### App Store / Play Store

## Children's Privacy

Spendly does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is designed for general audiences and does not target children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, please contact us.

## Data Security

While we do not collect your data, we take security seriously:

### On-Device Security
- **Biometric Lock**: Optional Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint protection
- **Local Encryption**: Sensitive data is stored using secure AsyncStorage
- **No Passwords**: We don't store passwords because we don't have user accounts

### Your Responsibility
- Keep your device secure with a passcode/biometric lock
- Don't share your device with untrusted people
- Regular backups protect against data loss

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:

### Right to Access
- All your data is visible within the app
- Export feature provides CSV access to all data

### Right to Delete
- Delete individual transactions, budgets, or goals within the app
- "Clear All Data" option in Settings
- Uninstall the app to remove all data permanently

### Right to Portability
- Export your data as CSV at any time
- CSV files can be imported into Excel, Google Sheets, or other apps
